# Poly-IoT-Project
Use a BME280 sensor for temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring with a Raspberry Pi as the gateway. MQTT transmits data, and Python controls the fan based on thresholds. The dashboard shows real-time data, triggers alarms, and allows remote fan control to maintain optimal conditions in the bakery.
